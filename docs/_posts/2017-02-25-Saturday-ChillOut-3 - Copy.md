TechTonic <br>
Mozilla Web extensions Hands-on Workshop & Hackathon
<br>
7th October 2017

           A bunch of web enthusiasts on a pleasant Saturday morning of October’s first week had their weekend plans straight. Around 45 of them gathered in a groundbreaking session and a workshop on Mozilla web extensions. Perhaps, all of us would be using those invaluable tools but only few wanted to dig a bit deeper and know how to create them.
           TechTonic was a two day hands-on web extensions and a hackathon conducted on 7th & 8th October 2017 at SRM University Kattakulathur, Chennai. The knowledge during the workshop was driven by Mr. KS Viswaprasath , Mr. Karthickeyan Narasimhan,Mr. Dinesh M V & Mr. Balaji prominent Mozilla Tech Speakers and Mozilla Campus Club advisory committee members. It was a part of the Activate Mozilla campaign. 
          The objective of the event had been to teach the participants the process of making a web extension on the Firefox browser. Initially, the flow of it starts with conceptualizing the idea, then weighing its pros, coding it, testing and uploading it for verification.
