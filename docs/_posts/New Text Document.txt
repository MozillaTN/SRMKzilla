SRMKZILLA was once more up with another enthralling seminar this weekend, fascinating a good number of tech geeks in its first session of Saturday chill out.
The talking note being "Hands on session on the development and deployment of srmkzilla website", the crowd was totally intent and amazed to discover the details of website development.

A proficient job was done by Sanyam, Aayush and Rohit on the session. Their masterly knack towards web development acted as a great mentor.
This is just the dawn. Stick around and stay tuned for many more forthcoming #SaturdayChillOuts .
